INTRODUCTION
----------------------------------------------------------------------


Polaris is an open source project created to display an open source website for University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill students and employees detailing accessible walking paths within the University. Polaris lists current accessibility hazards and allows users to post issues to notify other students and faculty of disruptions such as a broken elevator. On the about page is a form to submit feedback. 

In the future, users will have the ability to use the map to navigate around inaccessible paths, filter by favorited locations, and upvote/downvote others' notifications.

This app has not been deployed due to lack of functionality for user authentication, although endpoints and initial pages exist for users to register an account, update their information, see their information somewhere, and delete their account.

This project was built with a MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node.js). Other package dependency and version information can be found in `package.json` or in the dependency list below.
